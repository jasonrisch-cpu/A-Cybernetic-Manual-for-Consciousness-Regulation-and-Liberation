## A.3 Constraint-Based Design

Practices derived from this framework should respect:

1. Resolution precedes control  
2. Regulation precedes insight  
3. Discharge precedes stability  
4. Safety precedes intensity  
5. Autonomy precedes authority  

Violation of these constraints predicts adverse outcomes.

## A.4 Risk Conditions

High-risk contexts include:

- unresolved trauma  
- dissociation  
- psychosis history  
- active addiction  
- severe depression  
- unstable environments  

In these contexts, unsupervised application is contraindicated.

No part of this text constitutes medical, psychological, or legal advice.
