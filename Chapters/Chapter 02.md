# Chapter 2 — Pixels, Refresh, and Formation

## From Apparent Continuity to Discrete Events

Experience appears continuous.

Colors seem stable.  
Sounds seem extended.  
The body feels persistent.  
Thoughts feel like streams.

Yet when attention is sufficiently stable, experience reveals a different structure:

> **What appears continuous is composed of discrete, rapidly refreshing events.**

This framework refers to these events as **pixels**—not as literal visual dots, but as the **smallest phenomenologically observable units of experience**.

This is not a claim about physical atoms, neurons, or metaphysical units.

It is a description of how experience behaves when observed carefully from the inside.

## Pixels as Events, Not Objects

A pixel is not a thing.

It has no duration, mass, or independent existence.

Functionally, a pixel is:

- a momentary experiential event  
- carrying qualitative information  
- arising and vanishing rapidly  

When observation is coarse, pixels blur together and appear solid.

When observation is refined, the flickering, granular nature of experience becomes evident.

This is why experience can feel:

- smooth at one time  
- vibratory, buzzy, or granular at another  

The change is not in experience itself.  
It is in the **resolution of observation**.

## Classical Parallel: *Citta* and *Cetasika*

Classical Abhidhamma uses the term **citta** to describe momentary mind-events, each accompanied by **cetasikas**—associated factors such as feeling-tone, attention, or intention.

This framework does not require acceptance of Abhidhamma metaphysics.

However, the mapping is useful:

- **citta** ≈ pixel-event  
- **cetasika** ≈ metadata carried by that event  

Both point to the same observation:

> **Experience does not unfold as continuous substance, but as rapidly arising and passing events with associated qualities.**

The language differs.  
The phenomenology aligns.

This mapping shows that the framework is not inventing new phenomena, but describing long-observed patterns using language optimized for precision and systems thinking.

## Refresh, Not Frames

It is tempting to imagine experience as unfolding in **frames**, like a film strip.

This analogy is misleading.

A frame implies:

- a static snapshot  
- a complete moment frozen in time  
- a boundary one could point to and say “this was now”  

Experience does not behave this way.

A more accurate analogy is **refresh**.

Like a modern display:

- different regions update at slightly different times  
- transitions smear across boundaries  
- persistence arises from rapid update, not static holding  

If you photograph a television screen mid-refresh, you may see:

- partial illumination  
- aliasing lines  
- gradients where one state is replacing another  

Experience behaves similarly.

This is why attempting to “catch the present moment” feels impossible.  
There is no single, complete moment to catch.

There is only ongoing replacement, and attempts to grasp it add tension without capturing anything.

## Refresh Rate and Felt Energy

As attention becomes more sensitive, the refresh process itself becomes noticeable.

This often appears phenomenologically as:

- buzzing  
- tingling  
- vibration  
- shimmer  

These sensations are frequently misinterpreted as:

- subtle energy  
- life force  
- spiritual vibration  

Within this framework, they are understood as:

> **Direct perception of refresh dynamics.**

Nothing mystical is required.

When observational resolution increases, what was previously smoothed over becomes visible.

## From Pixels to Formations

Pixels rarely appear alone.

They cluster.

When multiple pixel-events synchronize or reinforce one another, they form **formations**.

A formation is:

- a coherent pattern of pixels  
- standing out from the background field  
- temporarily stable relative to refresh  

Examples include:

- sounds  
- thoughts  
- bodily sensations  
- images  
- emotions  

Formations feel “solid” not because they are continuous, but because:

- refresh is rapid  
- clustering is reinforced  
- attention stabilizes the pattern  

Later chapters will show how **gain and attention** determine which formations dominate the screen.

## Apparent Solidity and Its Breakdown

Under ordinary conditions:

- refresh is fast  
- attention is diffuse  
- formations appear solid and continuous  

Under refined observation:

- refresh becomes noticeable  
- formations lose apparent solidity  
- the sense of “thingness” weakens  

This does not mean reality is dissolving.

It means:

> **The rendering process is becoming visible.**

## Plant-Side Correlates  
*(Neuroscience, Carefully Framed)*

Neuroscience studies the **plant**:  
the brain, nervous system, body, and sensors.

From that perspective, researchers observe:

- oscillatory activity  
- update cycles  
- neural firing patterns  
- sensory transduction delays  

These measurements correlate with:

- changes in experience  
- shifts in clarity  
- alterations in perceived continuity  

For example:

- altering hypothalamic activity affects arousal and felt energy  
- changing sensory input changes experiential content  
- disrupting neural rhythms alters perceptual stability  

These correlations are real and useful.

However, this framework maintains a clear boundary:

> **Correlation does not establish identity.**

Neuroscience tells us what changes in the plant when experience changes.  
It does not tell us what experience *is*.

Both perspectives can coexist without collapse.

## Reframing Common Assumptions (Chapter 2)

- **Traditional framing:** “Moments of consciousness are frozen instants.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Experience refreshes continuously; no moment is complete.

- **Traditional framing:** “Vibration means energy or spiritual force.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Vibration reflects perceived refresh dynamics.

- **Traditional framing:** “Formations are things in the mind.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Formations are temporary clusters of pixel-events.

- **Traditional framing:** “The brain creates experience.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Changes in the plant correlate with changes in the render.

## Why This Matters

Seeing experience as refresh-based rather than frame-based has several consequences:

- it undermines reification  
- it explains impermanence mechanically  
- it prepares the ground for craving, gain, and suffering  
- it prevents metaphysical overreach  

Most importantly, it shifts the question from:

> “What *is* experience made of?”

to:

> **“How does experience behave?”**

That shift allows this framework to operate with clarity, restraint, and safety.
