# Chapter 4 — The Attention Cursor

## Attention as Pointing

Attention is not mysterious.

Everyone already knows how to do it.

If you can:
- point your finger  
- move your eyes  
- drag a cursor with a mouse  
- touch a spot on a screen  

then you already understand attention.

In this framework, **attention is pointing**.

More precisely:

> **Attention functions as a movable cursor that can be directed toward formations on the screen.**

This cursor can move:
- automatically  
- habitually  
- or manually  

Understanding the difference is the beginning of freedom.

## Awareness and Attention  
*(Global vs Targeted)*

A crucial distinction must be made early.

### Awareness
- global  
- diffuse  
- continuously present in ordinary waking states  
- illuminates the entire screen  

Awareness does not choose.  
It does not aim.  
It does not prioritize.

It simply **makes experience present**.

### Attention
- local  
- targeted  
- directional  
- powerful  

Attention selects.  
Attention amplifies.  
Attention delivers energy.

If awareness is the room light,  
attention is the flashlight.

## The Cursor Metaphor

The cursor metaphor works because it captures three key properties:

1. **Direction** — where attention is pointed  
2. **Stability** — whether it stays there  
3. **Power** — how much energy is being delivered  

Just as with a mouse or stylus:
- you can move it deliberately  
- it can be pulled by interface elements  
- it can snap to targets automatically  

The same is true internally.

## Automatic Capture: How Craving Hijacks the Cursor

When a formation arises, it carries a **valence tag**.

That tag instructs the system what to do next.

In an untrained system, the sequence is:

1. A formation arises  
2. Valence tags it (pleasant / unpleasant / neutral)  
3. The cursor is automatically pulled toward it  
4. Attention stabilizes on the formation  
5. Energy begins to accumulate  

This pull is what is traditionally called **craving**.

Craving is not wanting in words.  
It is **cursor capture**.

You did not decide to point attention.  
The system routed it for you.

## Lock-On and the Felt Sense of Tension

When attention stabilizes on a formation, something becomes obvious:

- tension increases  
- tightness appears  
- the field feels compressed around the object  

This is not psychological.  
It is mechanical.

What you are feeling is **sustained energy delivery**.

The cursor is no longer passing over the formation.  
It is parked.

This lock-on is the beginning of **grasping**.

Once established, lock-on reinforces itself:

- attention increases gain  
- increased gain strengthens the formation  
- stronger formations attract more attention  
- a feedback loop forms

## Gain: How Much Power Is Being Applied

Pointing alone is not enough to explain intensity.

For that, we need **gain**.

Gain answers the question:

> **“How much energy is being delivered to where attention is pointed?”**

Gain is not positive or negative.  
It is **amplitude**.

A simple phenomenological scale works well:

- **0** — no delivery (off)  
- **1–3** — low, background  
- **4–6** — moderate, engaging  
- **7–10** — high, dominating  

High gain:
- makes formations feel close  
- increases urgency  
- amplifies tension  
- narrows the field  

Low gain:
- allows distance  
- preserves spaciousness  
- prevents lock-in  

Craving is not just pointing.  
It is **pointing with gain**.

## Sliders and Dualisms

Most experiential qualities live on **sliders**, not switches.

Examples:
- pleasant ↔ unpleasant  
- hot ↔ cold  
- light ↔ dark  
- effort ↔ ease  
- approach ↔ avoid  

These are often experienced as **−10 ↔ +10 axes**.

Gain is different.

Gain is **0–10 only**:
- off → maximum  

A neutral sensation can become overwhelming if gain is high.  
A pleasant sensation can be barely noticed if gain is low.

This explains why:
- the same event affects people differently  
- tolerance matters more than content  
- regulation precedes insight

## Manual Control: Calibration Begins Here

Once misidentification weakens, something new becomes possible.

You can point the cursor **manually**.

This feels exactly like:
- choosing where to look  
- moving your hand deliberately  
- guiding a tool  

The difference is subtle but decisive:

- **Automatic** — the cursor is pulled  
- **Manual** — the cursor is placed  

This does not mean craving never arises.  
It means it no longer has exclusive control.

Manual control does not mean suppression.  
It means redirection without resistance.

Calibration — described later — is the skill of:
- knowing where the cursor is  
- knowing how much gain is applied  
- moving both deliberately

## Classical Parallels  
*(Carefully Framed)*

Classical Indian models describe multiple “functions of mind,” such as:
- **manas** — sensory-mind coordination  
- **buddhi** — pattern discrimination  
- **ahaṃkāra** — self-referential tagging  

These can be mapped functionally:

- manas → input coordination  
- buddhi → pattern discrimination  
- ahaṃkāra → identity metadata applied during becoming  

None of these are entities.  
They are **roles in a control loop**.

The cursor metaphor integrates them without reification.

## Reframing Common Assumptions (Chapter 4)

- **Traditional framing:** “Attention just happens.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Attention can be automatic or manual.

- **Traditional framing:** “Craving is desire.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Craving is cursor capture plus gain.

- **Traditional framing:** “Concentration is effort.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Concentration is stabilized attention.

- **Traditional framing:** “Awareness and attention are the same.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Awareness is global; attention is targeted.

## Why This Matters

If attention is not understood mechanically, people try to solve suffering at the wrong layer:

- suppressing thoughts  
- fighting emotions  
- chasing states  

When attention is understood as a cursor with gain:

- craving becomes visible earlier  
- grasping is recognized as lock-on  
- becoming is seen as energy accumulation  
- release becomes possible before execution  

The next chapter will show how **grasping and becoming** complete the volitional circuit — and why action often occurs long after the tension has already dissolved.
