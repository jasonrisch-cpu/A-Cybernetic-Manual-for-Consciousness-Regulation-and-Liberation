# Chapter 3 — Valence as Routing Metadata

## What Valence Actually Is

Every formation that appears on the screen carries a basic tag.

This tag answers a single, simple question:

> **“What should the system do with this?”**

Classical traditions call this **vedanā**:
- pleasant  
- unpleasant  
- neutral  

In everyday language, valence is often confused with:
- emotion  
- preference  
- liking or disliking  
- moral evaluation  

In this framework, valence is none of those.

**Valence is routing metadata.**

It is not what the formation *is*.  
It is how the system is instructed to *handle* it.

## Valence Is Not a Feeling (Yet)

Phenomenologically, valence is detectable as a tone, but its function is prior to emotion.

Before there is:
- desire  
- aversion  
- narrative  
- reaction  

There is a tag.

This tagging occurs prior to intention, evaluation, or choice.  
It is pre-reflective and automatic.

That tag does not say:
- “I like this”  
- “I hate this”  
- “This matters”  

It says:
- **approach**  
- **avoid**  
- **ignore**  

Pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral are not judgments.  
They are **default control signals**.

Emotion, story, and preference arise *after* these signals are acted upon.

## Mechanical Analogy: File Routing

A useful analogy is a computer system handling incoming files.

A file arrives with a header:
- executable  
- archive  
- image  
- unknown  

The system does not yet know what the file *means*.  
It knows only what to *do* with it.

Valence functions the same way.

- Pleasant → route toward engagement  
- Unpleasant → route toward disengagement  
- Neutral → deprioritize  

No narrative is required.

## Where Valence Appears on the Screen

Valence is not an abstract label floating above experience.

It is felt.

However, it is not felt as:
- emotion  
- story  
- interpretation  

It is felt as a **bias** in the field:
- a slight pull  
- a slight push  
- or no movement at all  

This bias often shows up as:
- subtle leaning  
- readiness or recoil  
- tension or openness  
- inclination before intention  

Only later does it consolidate into emotion, thought, or action.

## Neutral Is Not Absence

Neutral valence is commonly misunderstood.

Neutral does not mean:
- blank  
- empty  
- irrelevant  
- nonexistent  

Neutral means:

> **“No immediate action is prioritized.”**

Neutral formations still refresh.  
They still appear on the screen.  
They still contribute to background load.

They are simply not amplified.

Unamplified does not mean inert.  
Neutral formations can accumulate and shape baseline load over time.

This distinction becomes important later, when passive accumulation and baseline tension are discussed.

## Valence Precedes Craving

Craving does not arise out of nothing.

It requires something to lock onto.

Valence provides the initial condition.

In sequence:

1. A formation arises  
2. Valence tags it  
3. Craving may engage based on that tag  

This is why:
- craving feels automatic  
- reactions seem instantaneous  
- “choice” appears downstream  

Craving is not the tag.  
Craving is what happens when sustained gain is applied to the tag.

That distinction will be developed fully in the next chapter.

## Classical Parallel: *Vedanā* in Dependent Origination

In dependent origination, *vedanā* appears before craving.

This ordering is not philosophical.  
It is mechanical.

Without a tag, there is nothing to grasp.  
Without grasping, there is no sustained load.  
Without sustained load, there is no suffering.

This framework preserves that insight while reframing its function in cybernetic terms.

## Plant-Side Correlates  
*(Neuroscience, Carefully Scoped)*

From the plant side, valence correlates with:

- reward and threat signaling  
- approach / avoid circuitry  
- neuromodulators influencing priority  

For example:
- dopaminergic signaling biases engagement  
- stress hormones bias withdrawal  
- baseline tone influences what stands out  

Again, these are correlations.

They tell us:
- how the plant behaves when valence shifts  

They do not tell us:
- what valence *is* from the inside  

Valence is known directly as **bias in experience**.

## Reframing Common Assumptions (Chapter 3)

- **Traditional framing:** “Pleasant and unpleasant are emotions.”  
  **Functional reframing:** They are routing tags that precede emotion.

- **Traditional framing:** “Neutral means nothing is happening.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Neutral means no action is prioritized.

- **Traditional framing:** “If I remove valence, nothing will matter.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Removing compulsive amplification does not remove function.

- **Traditional framing:** “Valence is personal preference.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Valence is a system-level control primitive.

- **Traditional framing:** “Preference is who I am.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Preference is repeated routing history.

## Why This Matters

Misunderstanding valence leads to:

- moralizing experience  
- suppressing sensation  
- fighting the system instead of understanding it  

Seeing valence clearly allows:

- earlier intervention  
- cleaner release  
- reduced suffering without suppression  

Most importantly, it reveals something crucial:

> **Freedom does not begin with choosing differently.**  
> **It begins with seeing the tag before the system runs.**

The next chapter will show how **attention and gain** interact with valence to produce craving.
