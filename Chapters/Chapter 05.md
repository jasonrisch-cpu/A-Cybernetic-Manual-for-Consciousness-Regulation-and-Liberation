# Chapter 5 — Craving, Grasping, and Becoming

## From Attention to Trajectory

Up to this point, we have described:

- how experience renders (Chapter 1–2)  
- how formations are tagged (Chapter 3)  
- how attention targets and amplifies (Chapter 4)  

These processes are present in every moment.

By themselves, they do not yet explain why:
- patterns repeat  
- actions feel compelled  
- suffering persists  
- life trajectories form  

For that, we need to understand how attention and gain become **self-reinforcing loops**.

This is the domain of craving, grasping, and becoming.

## Craving as Sustained Cursor Capture

Craving is commonly misunderstood as desire in words.

It is not.

Craving is mechanical.

Craving occurs when:

> Attention remains captured on a formation  
> and gain continues to be applied.

Formally:

- A formation arises  
- Valence biases routing  
- Attention locks on  
- Gain is sustained  

At this point, craving is active.

No narrative is required.  
No intention is required.

The system is now investing energy.

---

## Grasping: Stabilizing the Loop

If craving continues, a second process emerges: **grasping**.

Grasping is stabilization.

It is what happens when the feedback loop between formation, attention, and gain becomes self-maintaining.

Mechanically:

1. Attention increases gain  
2. Gain strengthens the formation  
3. Stronger formation attracts attention  
4. Attention further increases gain  

This loop begins to run on its own.

Grasping is not clinging in thought.  
It is **energetic locking**.

Phenomenologically, it appears as:
- tightening  
- narrowing  
- fixation  
- “stuckness”  

Once grasping is established, disengagement requires deliberate intervention.

---

## Becoming: Compilation and Reorganization

When grasping persists, the system begins to reorganize around the locked formation.

This phase is traditionally called **becoming**.

In this framework, becoming is best understood as **compilation**.

The system begins to:

- recruit memory  
- activate identity tags  
- prepare motor programs  
- assemble narratives  
- allocate resources  

The formation is no longer read-only.

It becomes executable.

What began as a sensation or thought is now a runnable pattern.

This is why people often say:

“I don’t know how I ended up doing that.”

By the time awareness notices, compilation is complete.

---

## Birth: Execution of the Program

When compilation reaches threshold, execution occurs.

Traditions call this **birth**.

Here, it means:

> The program runs.

This may appear as:
- speech  
- movement  
- emotional outburst  
- habitual behavior  
- avoidance  
- compulsive action  

Execution feels immediate.

In reality, it is delayed output.

The causal work happened earlier, during craving and grasping.

---

## Deferred Causality and the Illusion of Choice

Because compilation happens upstream, action appears spontaneous.

From inside experience, it feels like:

“I chose.”  
“I decided.”  
“I acted.”

Mechanically, what occurred was:

- energy accumulated  
- structures formed  
- thresholds crossed  
- output triggered  

Choice is often a narrative attached after execution.

This does not mean agency is impossible.  
It means agency operates earlier than most people realize.

Freedom lies in intervening before compilation completes.

---

## The Full Control Loop

We can now describe the complete cycle:

1. Formation arises  
2. Valence tags it  
3. Attention targets it  
4. Gain is applied  
5. Craving sustains capture  
6. Grasping stabilizes the loop  
7. Becoming compiles patterns  
8. Birth executes output  

If no interruption occurs, the cycle runs to completion.

This is dependent origination described in control-theoretic terms.

---

## Residue and Pattern Formation

Execution does not end the process.

Every completed loop leaves residue.

Residue includes:
- reinforced pathways  
- strengthened preferences  
- increased sensitivity  
- conditioned expectations  

These residues bias future routing.

They make similar loops more likely.

This is how habits, identities, and life trajectories form.

Not through intention,  
but through repetition.

---

## Plant-Side Correlates  
*(Neuroscience, Carefully Scoped)*

On the plant side, this loop correlates with:

- reinforcement learning  
- synaptic plasticity  
- reward prediction  
- habit circuitry  
- motor preparation  

For example:
- repeated activation strengthens pathways  
- anticipation alters baseline tone  
- action readiness precedes conscious report  

Again, these are correlations.

They describe what the plant does when loops stabilize.

They do not replace phenomenology.

## Reframing Common Assumptions (Chapter 5)

- **Traditional framing:** “Craving is wanting things.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Craving is sustained attention plus gain.

- **Traditional framing:** “Clinging is psychological.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Grasping is energetic stabilization.

- **Traditional framing:** “Becoming is reincarnation.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Becoming is pattern compilation.

- **Traditional framing:** “I act freely.”  
  **Functional reframing:** Action reflects upstream accumulation.

## Why This Matters

Understanding this loop changes everything.

It shows that suffering is not caused by:
- bad thoughts  
- wrong desires  
- moral failure  

It is caused by:
- unmanaged feedback  
- unchecked amplification  
- unconscious compilation  

When the loop is seen clearly:

- craving can release early  
- grasping can dissolve  
- becoming can be interrupted  
- execution can be prevented  

Freedom does not require perfect behavior.

It requires seeing the loop before it closes.

The next chapter will show how sustained loops create **structural suffering** — and why tension becomes the default state of untrained systems.
