# Intended Use

This book is not a training curriculum.

It is a **mechanical specification** for how human experience operates.

It describes:

- rendering  
- attention routing  
- load formation  
- regulation  
- integration  
- ethical coherence  

from a first-person systems perspective.

If you are:

- a therapist  
- a counselor  
- a teacher  
- a coach  
- a curriculum designer  
- a workshop facilitator  
- a researcher  
- or a systems engineer working with human performance  

this book is intended as a reference model.

Not a script.  
Not a recipe.  
Not a certification.

## Use as Constraint, Not Authority

If you design practices, exercises, or teaching material:

Use these models as **constraints**.

They define:

- what destabilizes systems  
- what increases load  
- what promotes regulation  
- what prevents retraumatization  
- what supports integration  

If your material violates these constraints,  
expect instability.

Possible symptoms include:

- emotional flooding  
- dissociation  
- dependency  
- burnout  
- spiritual bypass  
- retraumatization  

These are not failures of participants.

They are design errors.
